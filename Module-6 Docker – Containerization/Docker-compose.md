## Docker Recap — Environment Replication and Container Management

so now we understand how docker works and how it solves the pain point of environment replication.

---

## Quick Recap

* you need a VM or any machine where docker is installed — either docker CLI or docker desktop
* once docker is set up, you can start managing the lifecycle of your containers


## Example Scenario — React Application Containerization

for example, in a company developers are working on a react application and they ask you:

> “hey omkar, can you containerize or dockerize this application?”

### steps involved:

* create a dockerfile
* set up a call with the developers to understand the application requirements
* choose the base image
* run commands to install all the dependencies required for the application
* copy the source code
* expose the required ports
* define the entrypoint


## Step 2 — Build and Run the Application

* create the docker image using:

  ```
  docker build -t <image-name> .
  ```
* after building the image:

  * push it to docker hub
  * run the docker container from that image


## Multi-Container Scenario — Docker Compose

now consider another scenario — what if you have an e-commerce application that requires a multi-container setup?

* docker compose is used to manage multi-container applications
* an e-commerce application usually follows a multi-service or microservice architecture
* when working with multiple containers, we need to manage the execution order and dependencies between services

### Example:

* a payment or catalog service will not run properly without a database
* docker compose helps define all services in one place
* it manages how containers start and interact with each other
