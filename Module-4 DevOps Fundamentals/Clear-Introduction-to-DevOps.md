# A Clear Introduction to DevOps and Its Importance


## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that improve an organization’s ability to deliver projects and applications efficiently.  
DevOps is not only about CI/CD .... it involves many other vital aspects of a project, such as:

- Improving delivery  
- Automation  
- Enhancing Quality  
- Monitoring (Observability)  
- Continuous Testing  

**PS:** DevOps is the process of improving application delivery by automating tasks, increasing quality, and ensuring continuous monitoring and continuous testing.


## Why DevOps?

As shown in the diagram earlier, all these activities were traditionally manual. Multiple teams worked in silos, and it often took many days to release a project or application. DevOps streamlines and accelerates this entire process.
